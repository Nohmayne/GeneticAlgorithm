# Genetic-Algorithm
This is a genetic algorithm I made using Python for my 2018-2019 sophomore year intensified science project. Depend on what is commented out, data can be printed in the console or exported to a google sheet. For the second option, it is likely a new client_secret.json will have to be generated through the google developer console and google sheets api. Enjoy!
