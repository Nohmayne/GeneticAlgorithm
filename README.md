# Genetic-Algorithm
This is a genetic algorithm I made using Python for my 2018-2019 sophomore year intensified science project. To run the program, use python to run the "Main.py" file in the "Code" folder. Depending on what is commented out, data can be printed in the console or exported to a google sheet. For the second option, it is likely a new client_secret.json will have to be generated through the google developer console and google sheets api. Enjoy!
